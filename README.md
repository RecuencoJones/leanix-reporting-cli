# leanix-reporting-cli
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40leanix%2Freporting-cli.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40leanix%2Freporting-cli)

Command line interface to initialise, develop and publish custom reports for LeanIX EAM Tool.
Please also have a look at the corresponding reporting library: https://github.com/leanix/leanix-reporting

## Prerequisites
* Node.js >= 6.9 (check with `node -v`)
* npm >= 3 (check with `npm -v`)

## Getting started
Install the package globally via npm:
```
npm install -g @leanix/reporting-cli
````

Initialize a new project:
```
mkdir myreport
cd myreport
lxr init
npm install
```

Configure your environment in `lxr.json`:
```
{
  "host": "app.leanix.net",
  "apitoken": "Jw8MfCqEXDDubry64H95SKYPjJTBKNFhkYD8kSCL"
}
```

If an API token is not available, you can also specify a workspace and log in with your workspace user:
```
{
  "host": "app.leanix.net",
  "workspace": "myworkspace"
}
```

Start developing:
```
npm start
```

### Operating behind a proxy server
If you are operating behind a proxy simply add the "proxyURL" attribute to the `lxr.json` file as follows:
```
{
  "host": "app.leanix.net",
  "apitoken": "Jw8MfCqEXDDubry64H95SKYPjJTBKNFhkYD8kSCL"
  "proxyURL" "<add your proxy url here>"
}
```

### Security hint
When you run `npm start` a local webserver is hosted on localhost:8080
that allows connections via HTTPS. But since just a development SSL certificate is created
the browser might show a warning that the connection is not secure.

You could either allow connections to this host anyways, or create your own self-signed
certificate: https://www.tonyerwin.com/2014/09/generating-self-signed-ssl-certificates.html#MacKeyChainAccess

If you have created your certificate you can add the certificate and private key files to the
`lxr.json` configuration file of your generated project:

```
{
  "host": "app.leanix.net",
  "apitoken": "Jw8MfCqEXDDubry64H95SKYPjJTBKNFhkYD8kSCL",
  "ssl": {
    "cert": "/path/to/cert",
    "key": "/path/to/key"
  }
}
```

For Windows users using IE11 or Microsoft Edge, follow [these instructions](docs/WinSSL.md).

### Port of local dev server
By default the local dev server is hosted on port 8080. You can change that in your `lxr.json` via the `"localPort"` setting:
```
{
  "host": "app.leanix.net",
  ...
  "localPort": "4200"
}
```

## Uploading to LeanIX workspace
In order to upload your report to a LeanIX workspace you can simply run the following command:

```
npm run upload
```

This command will build your project, bundle everything into an archive, add some meta information about your report and upload the whole package to the host server configured in `lxr.json`.
Now your report is hosted on that host for the workspace that you have configured in `lxr.json` and can be made available to users of that workspace.

The files that will be uploaded are:
* `src/index.html`
* The results of bundling the JavaScript files
* Everything in `src/assets`
* A metadata file, containing information about your project that is extracted from your `package.json`

## Building your report
To build your report and distribute the result via some other way (instead of uploading it) you can run the following command:

```
npm run build
```

It will build your project and output the result into a `dist` folder.

## Making your report available for other users (Not yet available in LeanIX)
If you have uploaded your report for a certain workspace, a new entry should be available in that workspace under `Administration - Reports`.
If you open the details of that report by clicking on the report name you should be able to view the report via the `<Open>` link.
This link can also be shared with other users (e.g. to get their feedback) without being publicly visible within the workspace.

## Important files

### package.json
This file contains information about your project. When uploading the report into LeanIX some of the information is used when displaying your report to the user.

Example `package.json`:
```
{
  "name": "leanix-quality-chart-report",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "LeanIX GmbH",
  "description": "This report shows the overall quality of your Fact Sheets per Fact Sheet type",
  "leanixReport": {
    "id": "net.leanix.quality-chart",
    "title": "Quality Chart",
    "documentationLink": "https://dev.leanix.net/example-docs",
    "defaultConfig": {
      "factSheetTypes": ["Application"]
    }
  }
}
```

Description of the properties that we extract from `package.json` when uploading your report to LeanIX:
* `name`: Name for your report project
* `version`: Version of your report
* `author`: Creator of the report (optional)
* `description`: Description of your reports use case (optional)
* `leanixReport`: Additional properties used by LeanIX
  * `id`: Unique ID for your report, we encourage you to follow Java package naming convention to force uniqueness(https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/namingpkgs.html)
  * `title`: Title for your report that is displayed in the GUI (optional)
  * `documentationLink`: Link to a documentation of your report (optional)
  * `defaultConfig`: Default configuration object, that can be adapted by the user (optional if your report is not configurable)

### lxr.json
This file contains specific configuration for developing, testing and uploading your report. It is not meant to be tracked by version control, since
it may contain user specific API Tokens. The file should be encoded in `utf-8` to be processable by the reporting-cli.

### src/index.html
This file is initially loaded by the LeanIX reporting framework and is hence the starting point for the execution of your report within the users browser.

### src/index.js
This file is the starting point for bundling JavaScript into one file. You can use the `import` statement (https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) in order to split up your project into multiple files. We use webpack 3.x under the hood to bundle your project.

# For reporting-cli developers

## Publish new version
* Bump version in `package.json`
* Make sure you have logged in to publish to npm registry in scope `@leanix` (`npm login` - see: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/adduser)
* Execute `npm publish --access public`
